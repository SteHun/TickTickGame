# Everything we added
* Better sound effects
* We fixed a bug where you could still win, even after losing, during the animation
* Added a camera, UI elements stay in the same place on screenspace and there is a bounding box
* We improved the physics with coyote time and jump buffers. 
* Now visual indication when stepping on hot tile.
* Change explosion animation.
* Added an editor.
* Added parallax.
* Cloud count is now based on level width.
* Can jump on rockets to destroy them, holding space gives a bigger bounce.
* 2nd line in level data is now reserved for time the player has to complete the level.
* Made a different collision detection, where you can decide how forgiving it should be (implemented on enemies).
