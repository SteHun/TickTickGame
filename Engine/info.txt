Engine
| AssetManager: A glorified wrapper for content.Load methods. It has a static member that's used across the game. 
| ExtendedGame: The base game class where you can find the Update, Draw, etc. methods. TickTick.TickTick inherits from this. 
| GameObject: Seems be be the generic base class for a bunch of game objects. It contains a basic velocity system and can have a parent to base its position of. 
| GameObjectList: Seems to be a GameObject which contains other GameObjects as children. Inherits from GameObject. 
| GameState: An abstract class. It contains the root GameObjectList which contains all current GameObjects. It doesn't seem to do much more than this. Inherited by specific states
| GameStatemanager: Contains a dictionary for several gamestates and a reference to the active one. Has the ability to add and switch game states. 
| IGameLoopObject: An interface with the blueprint for functions HandeInput, Update, Draw and Reset. However, it seems redundant as the interface is inherited but never used. 
| InputHelper: A simple input helper for mouse and keyboard. 
| SpriteGameObject: A game object with a sprite. It uses the SpriteSheet class
! NOTE: There seem to be two types of collision: with a bounding box and "pixel precise". The bounding box is stuck to the size of the sprite. No more no less. 
! The "pixel precise" collision checks if there are two non-transparent overlapping pixels which is inefficient and inflexible. We might want to change this. 
| SpriteSheet: This contains a sprite sheet texture and can draw the correct piece of the sprite sheet. It can also notify where there is transparency.  
| TextGameObject: A simple GameObject extension that draws text. 
| VisibilityTime: This entire class is never used lol
